This is preferred for private packages.\npublish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev\n\n# The following defines the version and build number for your application.\n# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43\n# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.\n# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter\n# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.\n# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.\n# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning\n# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.\n# Read more about iOS versioning at\n# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html\n# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts\n# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.\nversion: 1.0.0+1\n\nenvironment:\n  sdk: '>=3.0.1 <4.0.0'\n\n# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.\n# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions\n# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,\n# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to\n# the latest version available on pub.dev.
